# Overflow 2015 Hangout Sessions

**Purpose**

Here at Overflow we always stress how our job is only to show and inspire our members to build cool stuff, and hence it's only natural we provide you with a way to be able to re-visit the sessions you attend easily.

This repository will serve as a quick way for you to view each sessions' notes, coupled with a few reference links that we find will be useful.

Links to slides will also be posted here within 48 hours of the actual session actually taking place.

## Feedback
If you have any suggestions for tracks, or on how we can improve the program in general, our emails are always open at [ict.overflow@gmail.com](mailto://ict.overflow@gmail.com).

We'll really appreciate it if you can send us as many of those as you can!
